- Fixed PromptManager.jsx fetch calls — response.ok checks now present on all endpoints
- Fixed memory.js sort comparison — now type-safe with NaN/Date.parse validation
- Fixed silent catch in useTheme.js — now has console logging instead of swallowing errors
- Fixed agentActionExecutor.js:137 — reformatted complex ternary for readability
- Fixed memorySync.js `rows[0]` — added optional chaining with nullish coalescing fallback
- Fixed db.js `rows[0]` — added optional chaining with empty object fallback
- Resolved hardcoded localhost in lmStudioManager.js/memoryClassifier.js — server-side connections to local LM Studio with env var overrides, not a bug
- Resolved empty `.catch(() => {})` in client files — `request()` in api.js already shows `toast.error()` centrally; catches just prevent unhandled rejection warnings
- Resolved silent catches in runner.js — intentional best-effort writes during error handling
- Resolved Settings.jsx:366 catch — error toast already fires via centralized `request()` handler
- DRY: Extended PATHS object with 15 new centralized path constants in fileUtils.js
- DRY: Migrated 36 files from local `__dirname`/`process.cwd()` path definitions to centralized PATHS
- DRY: Replaced 57 `mkdir({recursive:true})` calls across 26 files with `ensureDir()`/`ensureDirs()`

## Code Audits

### Audit Findings (2026-03-05) — Resolved

Items fixed from audit Passes 1-3 (PRs #67-72):
- App status computation duplication (apps.js) — unified
- TOCTOU race in addTask/updateTask/deleteTask — withStateLock mutex added
- Fetch timeouts missing in cosRunnerClient.js — fetchWithTimeout added to all calls
- Socket.IO infinite reconnection — capped to 10 attempts with error handler
- Data race in memory.js loadMemory() — withMemoryLock applied
- Duplicate getDateString — centralized in lib/fileUtils.js
- Duplicate HOUR/DAY constants — centralized in lib/fileUtils.js
- Missing fetch timeouts in moltworld/moltbook api.js — timeout-aware patterns added
- ChiefOfStaff.jsx useState hooks — reduced from 24 to 19

**Known low-severity:** pm2 ReDoS (GHSA-x5gf-qvw8-r2rm) — no upstream fix, not exploitable via PortOS routes.
