# PortOS

**Your self-hosted operating system for dev machines.** Manage apps, orchestrate AI agents, build your digital twin, capture knowledge, and track your health — all from a single dashboard accessible anywhere via [Tailscale](https://tailscale.com).

Think [Umbrel](https://umbrel.com), but for your active git repos, AI workflows, and personal knowledge. Access everything from your phone, tablet, or any device on your Tailscale network.

## Why PortOS?

Most developers juggle a dozen tools — PM2 terminals, JIRA boards, AI chat windows, note apps, health trackers. PortOS unifies them into a single local-first dashboard that runs on your dev machine and travels with you over Tailscale.

- **One dashboard** for all your apps, agents, and knowledge
- **AI agents that work while you sleep** — autonomous task execution with multi-model orchestration
- **Your identity, quantified** — genomics, chronotype, taste profiling, and mortality-aware goal tracking
- **Second brain included** — capture thoughts, auto-classify them, and surface insights with daily digests
- **Mobile-first design** — manage your entire dev environment from your phone

- **Code Runner** — In-app code execution with syntax highlighting

### Voice Mode (Local)

Push-to-talk and hands-free voice assistant with no PortOS-hosted server dependencies. TTS and LLM run locally; STT is fully offline with whisper.cpp.

- **STT** — browser Web Speech API by default (zero-latency, no PortOS server process needed). **Note:** the Web Speech API in Chrome and most Chromium browsers forwards audio to a vendor cloud speech service (Google); for fully-offline STT with no data leaving the machine, select local [whisper.cpp](https://github.com/ggerganov/whisper.cpp) under *Settings → Voice → STT engine*. Optional CoreML encoder gives 2–3× speedup on Apple Silicon
- **Local TTS** — [Kokoro-82M](https://huggingface.co/onnx-community/Kokoro-82M-v1.0-ONNX) running in-process via ONNX Runtime (default, cross-platform), or [Piper](https://github.com/rhasspy/piper) CLI as a lightweight alternative
- **Local LLM** — routed through your existing LM Studio installation
- **Push-to-talk** — click and hold the mic widget or hold `Space` to speak; release to send
- **Barge-in** — start a new turn while the assistant is speaking to interrupt and redirect
- **Configurable** — STT engine, TTS engine, voice, Whisper model size, CoreML, speech rate, system prompt all editable from Settings

Enable under *Settings → Voice*; PortOS provisions required voice components as needed on first enable — `whisper-cpp` via Homebrew (when STT is whisper), Piper + phonemize libs pulled from [rhasspy/piper](https://github.com/rhasspy/piper) GitHub Releases (when TTS is Piper), and selected Whisper/Piper models downloaded into `~/.portos/voice/`. Full setup in [Voice Mode docs](./docs/features/voice.md).

### Meatspace (Physical Health)

Track your biological self alongside your digital one.

- **Genome Visualization** — Genetic trait markers, cancer risk categories, and health predispositions (117 SNP markers)
- **Blood Work** — Biomarker data tracking and trend analysis
- **Body Composition** — Physical measurements and body tracking
- **Age Metrics** — Biological vs chronological age tracking
- **Lifestyle Tracking** — Alcohol, nicotine, and lifestyle factor monitoring
- **Health Import** — Import data from Apple Health and other sources

### Infrastructure

## Quick Start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/atomantic/PortOS.git
cd PortOS
./setup.sh
pm2 start ecosystem.config.cjs
pm2 save
```

Access PortOS at `http://localhost:5555` (or via Tailscale at `http://<machine>.<tailnet>.ts.net:5555`).

For HTTPS (recommended — required for the in-browser microphone, and you'll get a trusted cert via Tailscale's Let's Encrypt integration):

```bash
npm run setup:cert         # uses `tailscale cert` if available, else self-signed
pm2 restart ecosystem.config.cjs
```

After that, `https://<machine>.<tailnet>.ts.net:5555` is the user-facing URL on every device. The same `:5555` is used for both HTTP and HTTPS — only the scheme changes. When HTTPS is enabled a loopback-only HTTP mirror also spawns at `http://localhost:5553` so local curl/scripts skip cert warnings (override with `PORTOS_HTTP_PORT`).

PM2 keeps PortOS running in the background and auto-restarts on reboot (with `pm2 save` + `pm2 startup`).

### Development Mode

```bash
npm run install:all    # Install all dependencies
npm run dev            # Vite hot-reload on :5554, API on :5555 — open :5554 in dev
```

`:5554` is **only** used in dev for the Vite hot-reload server; in production (`npm start` / PM2) the React build is served from `:5555` directly.

## Network Access

PortOS binds to `0.0.0.0` so you can access it from any device on your Tailscale network:

- Manage apps running on your home dev machine from anywhere
- Check logs and restart services from your phone
- View dashboard on your tablet while coding on your laptop

> **Security Note**: PortOS is designed for private Tailscale networks. Do not expose ports 5553-5561 to the public internet. See the [Security Audit](./docs/SECURITY_AUDIT.md) for hardening details.
