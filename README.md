# PortOS

**Your self-hosted operating system for dev machines.** Manage apps, orchestrate AI agents, build your digital twin, capture knowledge, and track your health — all from a single dashboard accessible anywhere via [Tailscale](https://tailscale.com).

Think [Umbrel](https://umbrel.com), but for your active git repos, AI workflows, and personal knowledge. Access everything from your phone, tablet, or any device on your Tailscale network.

## Why PortOS?

Most developers juggle a dozen tools — PM2 terminals, JIRA boards, AI chat windows, note apps, health trackers. PortOS unifies them into a single local-first dashboard that runs on your dev machine and travels with you over Tailscale.

- **One dashboard** for all your apps, agents, and knowledge
- **AI agents that work while you sleep** — autonomous task execution with multi-model orchestration
- **Your identity, quantified** — genomics, chronotype, taste profiling, and mortality-aware goal tracking
- **Second brain included** — capture thoughts, auto-classify them, and surface insights with daily digests
- **Mobile-first design** — manage your entire dev environment from your phone

## Quick Start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/atomantic/PortOS.git
cd PortOS
./setup.sh
pm2 start ecosystem.config.cjs
pm2 save
```

Access PortOS at `http://localhost:5554` (or via Tailscale at `http://[your-machine]:5554`).

PM2 keeps PortOS running in the background and auto-restarts on reboot (with `pm2 save` + `pm2 startup`).

### Development Mode

```bash
npm run install:all    # Install all dependencies
npm run dev            # Vite hot-reload on 5554, API on 5555
```

## Network Access

PortOS binds to `0.0.0.0` so you can access it from any device on your Tailscale network:

- Manage apps running on your home dev machine from anywhere
- Check logs and restart services from your phone
- View dashboard on your tablet while coding on your laptop

> **Security Note**: PortOS is designed for private Tailscale networks. Do not expose ports 5554-5561 to the public internet. See the [Security Audit](./docs/SECURITY_AUDIT.md) for hardening details.
