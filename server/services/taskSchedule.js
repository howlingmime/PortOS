  'feature-ideas': `[Improvement: {appName}] Implement a Feature Idea

You are working in a git worktree on a feature branch. Your goal is to implement ONE feature and open a PR.

Repository: {repoPath}

## Research Phase

1. Read GOALS.md from {repoPath} for context on the app's goals and priorities.
   If no GOALS.md exists, focus on general improvements.
2. Read PLAN.md from {repoPath} for the current roadmap and planned work.
3. Search for existing feature idea documents:
   - Check .planning/ directory for feature specs, research docs, or FEATURES.md
   - Check for any TODO.md, IDEAS.md, or similar feature tracking files
4. Review recent completed tasks and user feedback to understand patterns
5. Review recent git log to see what's been implemented recently

## Selection Phase

6. Choose ONE feature to implement that:
   - Aligns with GOALS.md priorities
   - Is NOT already planned in PLAN.md (avoid duplicating roadmap work)
   - Is NOT already documented in existing feature idea files
   - Is a small, self-contained improvement (completable in one session)
   - Saves user time, improves the developer experience, or makes the app more useful

## Implementation Phase

7. Implement the feature:
   - Write clean, tested code
   - Follow existing patterns in the codebase
   - Run tests to ensure nothing is broken

8. Run \`/simplify\` to review changed code for reuse, quality, and efficiency. Fix any issues found.

9. Commit with a clear description of the feature and rationale`,

   - User-facing error messages

2. Add error handling for:
   - Network requests
   - File operations
   - Database queries
   - External API calls

   - Type assertions that could be avoided
   - Missing interfaces/types for objects

2. Add types for:
   - Function parameters and returns
   - Component props
   - API responses
   - Configuration objects

3. Ensure:
   - Types are properly exported
   - No implicit any
   - Types are reusable

4. Run type checking and commit improvements`,

  'release-check': `[Improvement: {appName}] Release Check — dev → main

Check if the dev branch has accumulated enough work for a release, and if so, create a PR to main, wait for Copilot code review, iterate on feedback until clean, and merge.

NOTE: The repo has a GitHub ruleset that automatically requests a Copilot code review on every push to a PR targeting main. You do NOT need to manually request reviews — just create/push the PR and wait.

## Step 1: Evaluate Readiness

Read the current changelog and version:
- \`cat .changelog/v*.x.md\` (the one with literal "x", not a resolved version)
- \`node -p "require('./package.json').version"\`

Count substantive entries (lines starting with "###" or "- **" under Features, Fixes, Improvements sections). If fewer than 2 substantive entries exist, stop and report: "Not enough work accumulated for a release." Do NOT create a PR.

## Step 2: Verify Clean State

Run these checks (stop if any fail):
1. \`git fetch origin\` and ensure dev is up to date: \`git status -uno\` should show "Your branch is up to date"
2. \`cd server && npm test\` — all tests must pass
3. \`cd client && npm run build\` — build must succeed

## Step 3: Create or Find PR

Check for existing PR: \`gh pr list --base main --head dev --state open --json number,url\`

If a PR exists, use it. If not, create one:
\`\`\`bash
gh pr create --base main --head dev --title "Release $(node -p \\"require('./package.json').version\\")" --body "$(cat .changelog/v*.x.md | head -60)"
\`\`\`

Capture the PR number and URL.

## Step 4: Wait for Copilot Review

Copilot review is triggered automatically on push. Poll every 15 seconds until the review appears:
\`\`\`bash
gh api repos/atomantic/PortOS/pulls/PR_NUM/reviews --jq '.[] | select(.user.login == "copilot-pull-request-reviewer") | .state'
\`\`\`

Wait until you see APPROVED or CHANGES_REQUESTED. Timeout after 5 minutes of polling.

## Step 5: Address Feedback Loop (max 5 iterations)

### 5a. Fetch unresolved review threads

Use gh api graphql (JSON input to avoid shell escaping issues with GraphQL variables):

\`\`\`bash
echo '{"query":"query{repository(owner:\\"atomantic\\",name:\\"PortOS\\"){pullRequest(number:PR_NUM){reviewThreads(first:100){nodes{id,isResolved,comments(first:10){nodes{body,path,line,author{login}}}}}}}}"}' | gh api graphql --input -
\`\`\`

### 5b. If no unresolved threads: skip to Step 6 (Merge).

### 5c. If unresolved threads exist, evaluate each one:

For each comment, read the referenced file and critically evaluate the suggestion:
- **If the suggestion is valid and improves the code**: apply the fix
- **If the suggestion is a false positive, overly pedantic, or would make the code worse**: do NOT change the code

Either way, resolve every thread — the goal is zero unresolved threads before merge.

After evaluating all threads:
- If any code changes were made: run \`cd server && npm test\` to verify, then commit and push:
  \`git add <files> && git commit -m "fix: address Copilot review feedback"\`
  \`git pull --rebase --autostash && git push\`

### 5d. Resolve ALL threads via GraphQL mutation (both fixed and dismissed):

For each thread, use the thread node id from 5a:
\`\`\`bash
echo '{"query":"mutation{resolveReviewThread(input:{threadId:\\"THREAD_NODE_ID\\"}){thread{isResolved}}}"}' | gh api graphql --input -
\`\`\`

### 5e. Wait for new Copilot review if code was pushed (repeat Step 4)

If you pushed changes in 5c, the push automatically triggers a new Copilot review. Poll for it, then loop back to 5a. If no code changes were made (all threads were false positives), skip straight to Step 6.

If after 5 iterations there are still unresolved threads, stop and report what remains.

## Step 6: Merge

Only merge when Copilot's most recent review has NO unresolved threads:
\`\`\`bash
gh pr merge PR_NUM --merge
\`\`\`

If merge fails (e.g., branch protections), try: \`gh pr merge PR_NUM --merge --admin\`

## Step 7: Report

Summarize:
- Version released
- Key changes (from changelog)
- Number of review iterations needed
- Any unresolved issues

IMPORTANT: Always use \`git pull --rebase --autostash\` before pushing (dev branch gets auto-bumped by CI). Never use \`git push\` alone.`,

  'pr-reviewer': `[Improvement: {appName}] PR Review — Check Open PRs

Review open pull requests / merge requests on {appName} from other contributors and post code reviews on any that lack a review since the last commit.

Repository: {repoPath}

## Phase 0 — Prerequisites

0. Ensure slash-do is installed by running \`command -v slash-do\`. If not found, install it with \`npm install -g slash-do@latest\`.

## Phase 1 — Discover PRs

1. cd into {repoPath}
2. Detect SCM provider from git remote URL:
   - Contains "github.com" -> use \`gh\` CLI
   - Contains "gitlab" -> use \`glab\` CLI
3. List open PRs/MRs authored by others (not by atomantic):
   - GitHub: \`gh pr list --state open --json number,author,headRefName,updatedAt,title\`
   - GitLab: \`glab mr list --state opened -F json\`

## Phase 2 — Check Review Status

4. For each PR/MR from other contributors:
   - GitHub: \`gh pr view <number> --json reviews,commits\` — check if I have a review newer than the latest commit
   - GitLab: \`glab mr view <iid> -F json\` — check notes/approvals vs last commit date
5. Skip PRs where I already have a review posted after the most recent commit push

## Phase 3 — Review

6. For each PR/MR needing review:
   - cd into {repoPath}
   - Run \`/do:review\` to perform a deep code review of the changed files
   - Post the review:
     - GitHub: \`gh pr review <number> --comment --body "<review>"\`
     - GitLab: \`glab mr note <iid> --message "<review>"\`

## Phase 4 — Report

7. Summarize: apps checked, PRs reviewed (with links), PRs skipped (already reviewed)`

Evaluate existing features and consider new ones to make {appName} more useful:

Repository: {repoPath}

1. Read GOALS.md from {repoPath} for context on the app's goals and priorities.
   If no GOALS.md exists, focus on general improvements.
2. Review recent completed tasks and user feedback to understand patterns
3. Assess current features:
   - Are existing features working well toward our goals?
   - Are there features that could be improved or refined?
   - Are there features that are underperforming or causing friction?

4. Choose ONE action to take (in order of preference):
   a) IMPROVE an existing feature that isn't meeting its potential
   b) ADD a new high-impact feature
   c) ARCHIVE a feature that is not helping our goals

5. Implement it:
   - Write clean, tested code
   - Follow existing patterns
   - Update relevant documentation

6. Commit with a clear description of the change and rationale

Think critically about what we have before adding more.`
