### In Progress

- [ ] **M44 P6**: MeatSpace - Genome/Epigenetic Migration cleanup (genome routes moved, but route comments still reference `/api/digital-twin/genome/` and IdentityTab still renders a Genome card with broken link to `/digital-twin/genome`)

### Planned

- [x] **GSD Tab: Smart State Detection & Guided Setup** — Extend `GET /api/apps/:id/documents` to return GSD status fields and update GSD tab empty state with stepped setup guide
- [x] **GSD Tab: One-Click Agent Spawn & Open Claude Code** — Run buttons on setup steps create CoS tasks, Open Claude Code button launches CLI in app directory
- [x] **GSD Tab: Actionable Dashboard** — Fix phase file parsing bug, add phase action triggers, document CRUD, expandable phase cards with sub-plans/verification/research, deep-linkable phase and document views

#### GSD Smart State Detection

The GSD tab currently shows a binary state: project loaded or "No GSD project initialized". This misses intermediate states where partial GSD work exists (e.g., codebase mapped but no project created).

**Server Changes** — Extend `GET /api/apps/:id/documents` response to include GSD status:
- `hasCodebaseMap` — `.planning/codebase/` directory exists with analysis files
- `hasProject` — `.planning/PROJECT.md` exists
- `hasRoadmap` — `.planning/ROADMAP.md` exists
- `hasState` — `.planning/STATE.md` exists
- `hasConcerns` — `.planning/CONCERNS.md` exists

Check via `existsSync()` against `app.repoPath + '/.planning/...'` (same pattern as existing document checks).

**GSD Tab UI Changes** — Replace single empty state with stepped guide:
| State | What to show |
|---|---|
| Nothing (no `.planning/`) | "Run `/gsd:map-codebase` to analyze your codebase" |
| Has `.planning/codebase/` only | "Codebase mapped! Run `/gsd:new-project` to create a project" |
| Has `PROJECT.md` but no `ROADMAP.md` | "Project created. Run `/gsd:plan-phase` or create a roadmap" |
| Has `ROADMAP.md` + `STATE.md` | Full project view (current behavior) |

*Touches: `server/routes/apps.js` (extend documents endpoint), `client/src/components/apps/tabs/GsdTab.jsx` (stepped empty state), `client/src/services/api.js` (consume new fields)*

- [ ] **M34 P5-P7**: Digital Twin - Multi-modal capture, advanced testing, personas
- [ ] **M42 P5**: Unified Digital Twin Identity System - Cross-Insights Engine. See [Identity System](./docs/features/identity-system.md)
- [ ] **M44 P7**: MeatSpace - Apple Health Integration (live sync via Health Auto Export app + bulk XML import)
- [ ] **M45**: Data Backup & Recovery - Scheduled backup of `./data/` to external drive or NAS. All persistence is JSON files with zero redundancy — one bad write or disk failure loses brain, identity, health, and memory data. Incremental backup with restore verification.
- [ ] **M46**: Unified Search (Cmd+K) - Global search across brain, memory, history, agents, tasks, and apps. Hybrid vector + BM25 extended to all data sources. Keyboard-driven launcher overlay.

## Planned Feature Details

### M44 P7: Apple Health Integration

Bring Apple Health data into MeatSpace via two complementary paths: live sync from the [Health Auto Export](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/health-auto-export-json-csv/id1115567069) iOS app (~$4) and bulk historical import from Apple Health XML exports.

**Live Sync (Health Auto Export)**
- `POST /api/health/ingest` — accepts Health Auto Export JSON payload (metrics, workouts, sleep, ECG, medications)
- Validate payload with Zod, deduplicate by metric name + timestamp
- Persist to `data/health/YYYY-MM-DD.json` (one file per day, append/merge)
- Configure app to POST to `http://<tailscale-ip>:5554/api/health/ingest` on 15-60 min interval
- Support custom auth header for basic request validation
- 150+ metric types: steps, heart rate, HRV, VO2 max, sleep stages, blood pressure, workouts with GPS routes, etc.
- Reference: [health-auto-export-server](https://github.com/HealthyApps/health-auto-export-server), [payload schema](https://github.com/Lybron/health-auto-export)

**Bulk Historical Import (XML Export)**
- `POST /api/health/import-xml` — accepts Apple Health export ZIP upload
- Stream-parse `export.xml` using `xml-stream` (files can be 500MB+), extract records into same `data/health/YYYY-MM-DD.json` format
- Progress reporting via WebSocket during import
- Reference: [apple-health-parser](https://github.com/cvyl/apple-health-parser)

**MeatSpace Dashboard Integration**
- New dashboard cards for key Apple Health metrics (steps, heart rate, sleep, HRV trends)
- Correlate with existing MeatSpace data (alcohol intake vs. HRV/sleep, blood work trends vs. activity)
- Time-series charts with configurable date ranges

*Touches: server/routes/health.js, server/services/healthIngest.js, MeatSpace UI, data/health/*

### M45: Data Backup & Recovery

All PortOS data lives in `./data/` as JSON files with no redundancy. A corrupted write, accidental deletion, or disk failure loses everything — brain captures, digital identity, health records, memory embeddings, agent state, and run history.

**Scheduled Backup**
- Configurable backup target (external drive path, NAS mount, or rsync destination)
- Incremental backups using file modification timestamps — only copy changed files
- Configurable schedule (daily default) via existing automation scheduler
- Retention policy: keep N daily + N weekly snapshots, prune older
- Backup manifest with file checksums for integrity verification

**Restore**
- `POST /api/backup/restore` — restore from a named snapshot
- Dry-run mode that shows what would change before applying
- Per-directory selective restore (e.g., restore only `data/brain/` without touching `data/cos/`)

**Dashboard Widget**
- Last backup time, next scheduled backup, total backup size
- Backup health status (green/yellow/red based on age and integrity)
- One-click manual backup trigger

*Touches: new server/services/backup.js, server/routes/backup.js, Dashboard widget, settings.json, automation scheduler*

### M46: Unified Search (Cmd+K)

Global keyboard-driven search across all PortOS data sources from any page.

**Search Sources**
- Brain captures (ideas, projects, people, admin)
- Semantic memory (vector + BM25 hybrid, already exists)
- Command history and AI run history
- Agent activity and task logs
- Apps registry
- Digital twin documents, autobiography, taste summaries
- MeatSpace health entries

**UI**
- `Cmd+K` / `Ctrl+K` opens search overlay from any page
- Type-ahead with categorized results (Brain, Memory, Apps, History, etc.)
- Result cards with source icon, snippet, and timestamp
- Click navigates to deep-linked location (e.g., specific brain capture, agent run, history entry)

**Implementation**
- Server-side `/api/search` endpoint that fans out to existing service search functions
- Client-side `GlobalSearch` component mounted in Layout.jsx
- Debounced input with 200ms delay
- Results ranked by relevance with source-type boosting

*Touches: new server/routes/search.js, new server/services/search.js, new client/src/components/GlobalSearch.jsx, Layout.jsx*

### M47: Push Notifications

External notification delivery for critical events when not actively viewing the dashboard.

**Notification Channels**
- Discord webhook (post to a private channel)
- Telegram bot (send to chat ID)
- Generic webhook (POST JSON to any URL)
- Configurable per-channel: which event types to send

**Events**
- Agent task completed (with success/failure status and summary)
- Critical errors (PM2 crash, autofixer triggered)
- Goal milestone reached
- CoS health alert (agent stuck, high failure rate)
- Backup completed or failed (M45)

**Configuration**
- Settings page section for notification channels
- Per-channel event type toggles
- Test button to verify delivery
- Rate limiting to prevent notification spam (max N per hour per channel)

*Touches: new server/services/pushNotify.js, server/routes/settings.js, Settings UI, cosEvents.js, errorRecovery.js*

### M48: Google Calendar Integration

Shared Google OAuth2 foundation — `server/services/googleAuth.js` handles OAuth2 consent flow, token storage/refresh, scope management. Tokens stored in `data/google/auth.json`. Reused by both Calendar and Gmail.

**Phases:**

- **P1: Calendar Read & OAuth** — Google OAuth2 service, calendar event listing, basic week/month calendar UI, settings page for Google connection
- **P2: Calendar Write & Sync** — Event CRUD (create/update/delete synced to Google), two-way incremental sync using Google's `syncToken`, conflict detection (last-writer-wins, Google as source of truth for external events), configurable sync interval (default 5min)
- **P3: Smart Scheduling & CoS** — Free slot finder API, chronotype-aware slot selection (reads `data/digital-twin/chronotype.json` for peak-focus windows), auto-schedule human tasks during optimal windows, CoS autonomous job `job-calendar-schedule` for rescheduling when conflicts arise
- **P4: Calendar UI Polish** — Week/day/month views, color coding by source/type, dashboard calendar widget (today's events), linked goal/todo indicators on events

**Data:** `data/google/auth.json` (OAuth tokens), `data/calendar/events.json` (local event cache with Google sync tokens), `data/calendar/config.json` (sync settings, working hours, chronotype preferences)

**Routes:** `GET/POST/PUT/DELETE /api/calendar/events`, `POST /api/calendar/sync`, `GET /api/calendar/free-slots`, `POST /api/calendar/schedule-task`, `GET /api/google/oauth/start`, `GET /api/google/oauth/callback`, `GET /api/google/status`

### M49: Life Goals & Todo Planning

Extends the existing goal system in `server/services/identity.js` and `data/digital-twin/goals.json`. Adds rich progress tracking, todo sub-tasks, calendar time-blocking, and AI-powered check-ins. Gets its own top-level Goals page (not buried under Digital Twin).

**Phases:**

- **P1: Enhanced Goal Model & Todos** — Extend goal schema with: progress percentage + history, velocity (percent/month + trend), projected completion date, todo sub-tasks with status/priority/time estimates, time tracking (total minutes, weekly average). Dedicated Goals page with goal list and detail view
- **P2: Calendar Time-Blocking** (depends on M48 P2) — Schedule recurring goal work sessions on calendar, link calendar events to goals/todos via IDs, track actual time spent from calendar event durations, per-goal calendar config (preferred days, time slot preference, session duration)
- **P3: Check-in & Evaluation** — Periodic check-in prompts (weekly/monthly configurable per goal), AI evaluator uses Digital Twin + progress data to assess trajectory, timeline adjustment recommendations when behind schedule, CoS autonomous job `job-goal-check-in` for weekly evaluations, check-in history with mood/notes
- **P4: Dashboard & Visualization** — Goal progress dashboard widget with urgency badges, burn-down / progress timeline charts, integration with existing mortality-aware urgency scoring (M42 P3), "on track" / "behind" / "at risk" status indicators

**Data:** Extended `data/digital-twin/goals.json` with `todos[]`, `progressHistory[]`, `velocity{}`, `checkIns[]`, `calendarConfig{}`, `timeTracking{}` per goal. `checkInSchedule{}` at root level.

**Routes:** Extend `/api/digital-twin/identity/goals` with: `PUT /:id/progress`, `POST /:id/check-in`, `POST /:id/todos`, `PUT /:id/todos/:tid`, `POST /:id/schedule`, `POST /evaluate`

*Touches: server/services/identity.js (extend), new server/services/goalEvaluator.js, server/routes/identity.js (extend), client/src/pages/Goals.jsx, client/src/components/goals/tabs/, Layout.jsx, autonomousJobs.js*

### M50: Email Management

Multi-provider email integration — Gmail via Google OAuth (shared with M48) + Outlook via Microsoft Graph API (separate OAuth2 flow). Provider abstraction layer so both behave identically from the service layer up.

Always review before send — AI-generated drafts go to an outbox queue. The user reviews, edits, and approves each response before it's sent. No auto-send.

**Phases:**

- **P1: Email Read & Provider Auth** — Gmail API integration using shared Google OAuth (`gmail.modify` scope), Microsoft Graph API with separate OAuth2 for Outlook, provider abstraction layer (`emailProvider.js`), email listing with pagination, thread view, basic email inbox UI
- **P2: AI Categorization & Priority Extraction** — LLM-powered classification (action required, informational, promotional, social, receipts), configurable rules for known senders (skip AI for obvious categories like GitHub notifications), todo extraction from email content (linkable to M49 goal todos), priority scoring, Brain system integration for knowledge capture from action/info emails
- **P3: Response Drafting with Digital Twin** — Draft responses using Digital Twin voice/style (reads COMMUNICATION.md, PERSONALITY.md, VALUES.md + recent thread context), outbox queue with pending/approved/sent states, draft review/editing UI, all drafts require manual approval before sending
- **P4: CoS Automation & Rules** — Automated classification on new emails via CoS job `job-email-triage`, rule-based pre-filtering, email-to-task pipeline (email todos → M49 goal todos), priority email notifications via existing notification system

**Data:** `data/email/config.json` (sync settings, categories, rules, brain capture config), `data/email/cache/YYYY-MM-DD.jsonl` (date-bucketed email cache, bodies fetched on demand), `data/email/outbox.json` (draft queue with status tracking), `data/outlook/auth.json` (Microsoft OAuth tokens)

**Routes:** `GET /api/email/messages`, `GET /api/email/threads/:threadId`, `POST /api/email/sync`, `POST /api/email/classify/:id`, `POST /api/email/draft/:id`, `GET/PUT/POST/DELETE /api/email/outbox/:id`, `POST /api/email/outbox/:id/approve`

**Nav:** Top-level sidebar item "Email" (alphabetically between Digital Twin and Goals)
