## Next Up

1. **M34 P5-P7**: Digital Twin — Multi-modal capture, advanced testing, personas

## Backlog

- [ ] **God file decomposition** — Split cos.js, subAgentSpawner.js, digital-twin.js, routes/scaffold.js, routes/cos.js, client/api.js into focused modules; resolve circular dependency
- [ ] **Test coverage** — Critical gaps: cos.js, cosRunnerClient.js, agentActionExecutor.js (~29% service, ~12% route coverage)
- [ ] **M50 P9**: CoS Automation & Rules — Automated email classification, rule-based pre-filtering, email-to-task pipeline
- [ ] **M50 P10**: Auto-Send with AI Review Gate — Per-account trust level, second LLM reviews drafts. See [Messages Security](./docs/features/messages-security.md)

**Known low-severity:** pm2 ReDoS (GHSA-x5gf-qvw8-r2rm) — no upstream fix, not exploitable via PortOS routes.
