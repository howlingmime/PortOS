### Planned

- [ ] **M50 P1-P4**: Email Management - Gmail + Outlook integration, AI categorization and priority extraction, Digital Twin voice drafting, review-before-send outbox, Brain knowledge capture
- [ ] **M34 P5-P7**: Digital Twin - Multi-modal capture, advanced testing, personas
- [ ] **M42 P5**: Unified Digital Twin Identity System - Cross-Insights Engine. See [Identity System](./docs/features/identity-system.md)
- [ ] **M45**: Data Backup & Recovery - Scheduled backup of `./data/` to external drive or NAS. All persistence is JSON files with zero redundancy — one bad write or disk failure loses brain, identity, health, and memory data. Incremental backup with restore verification.
- [ ] **M47**: Push Notifications - Webhook-based alerts when agents complete tasks, critical errors occur, or goals stall. Discord/Telegram integration for mobile awareness without needing the dashboard open.
- [x] **M48 P1-P5**: Google Calendar Integration - MCP push sync, subcalendar management, goal-calendar linking, daily review with auto-progress-logging, dormancy support
- [ ] **M48 P6**: Calendar Consolidation - Merge MeatSpace > Calendar (Life Calendar / "4000 Weeks") under top-level Calendar as a "Lifetime" sub-tab, eliminating the confusing dual-calendar navigation
- [x] **M48 P7**: UI-Triggered Google Calendar Sync - "Sync Google" button in Sync tab + "Discover Calendars" in Config tab, both spawn headless Claude CLI with MCP to fetch events/calendar list. Works as zero-config fallback using user's existing Claude MCP auth.
- [x] **M48 P8**: Direct Google Calendar API Sync - `googleapis` npm with OAuth2 setup in Config tab, sync method selector (Claude MCP vs Google API), tokens cached in `data/calendar/google-auth/` with auto-refresh
- [ ] **M48 P9**: Auto-Configure Google OAuth via CDP - "Auto-Configure" button in Config tab launches Google Cloud Console in PortOS CDP browser. User logs in manually, then a Playwright script automates: create project, enable Calendar API, configure OAuth consent screen (add user as test user), create Web app credentials with redirect URI, extract client ID/secret, save to PortOS, and initiate the OAuth consent flow. Reduces multi-step manual setup to one click + Google login.
- [ ] **M49 P1-P4**: Life Goals & Todo Planning - Enhanced goal model with todos and milestones, calendar time-blocking, AI-powered periodic check-ins, mortality-aware progress dashboard
- [ ] **M52**: Update Detection - Poll GitHub releases for new version tags, compare against local `package.json` version, surface update availability in dashboard and settings

## Planned Feature Details

### M45: Data Backup & Recovery

All PortOS data lives in `./data/` as JSON files with no redundancy. A corrupted write, accidental deletion, or disk failure loses everything — brain captures, digital identity, health records, memory embeddings, agent state, and run history.

**Scheduled Backup**
- Configurable backup target (external drive path, NAS mount, or rsync destination)
- Incremental backups using file modification timestamps — only copy changed files
- Configurable schedule (daily default) via existing automation scheduler
- Retention policy: keep N daily + N weekly snapshots, prune older
- Backup manifest with file checksums for integrity verification

**Restore**
- `POST /api/backup/restore` — restore from a named snapshot
- Dry-run mode that shows what would change before applying
- Per-directory selective restore (e.g., restore only `data/brain/` without touching `data/cos/`)

**Dashboard Widget**
- Last backup time, next scheduled backup, total backup size
- Backup health status (green/yellow/red based on age and integrity)
- One-click manual backup trigger

*Touches: new server/services/backup.js, server/routes/backup.js, Dashboard widget, settings.json, automation scheduler*

### M47: Push Notifications

External notification delivery for critical events when not actively viewing the dashboard.

**Notification Channels**
- Discord webhook (post to a private channel)
- Telegram bot (send to chat ID)
- Generic webhook (POST JSON to any URL)
- Configurable per-channel: which event types to send

**Events**
- Agent task completed (with success/failure status and summary)
- Critical errors (PM2 crash, autofixer triggered)
- Goal milestone reached
- CoS health alert (agent stuck, high failure rate)
- Backup completed or failed (M45)

**Configuration**
- Settings page section for notification channels
- Per-channel event type toggles
- Test button to verify delivery
- Rate limiting to prevent notification spam (max N per hour per channel)

*Touches: new server/services/pushNotify.js, server/routes/settings.js, Settings UI, cosEvents.js, errorRecovery.js*

### M48: Google Calendar Integration

**Completed (P1-P5):** MCP push sync architecture — instead of OAuth2 complexity, Google Calendar events are synced via Claude Code MCP tools pushing to PortOS endpoints. Subcalendar management with enable/disable/dormant states, goal-calendar linking with match patterns, daily review UI for confirming events and auto-logging progress, dormancy support for inactive calendars.

**Remaining:**

- **P6: Calendar Consolidation** — MeatSpace > Calendar ("4000 Weeks" Life Calendar) and top-level Calendar are confusing dual navigation. Move the Life Calendar view under top-level Calendar as a "Lifetime" sub-tab. Remove the MeatSpace > Calendar nav entry. Ensure route `/calendar/lifetime` renders the existing Life Calendar component. Update Layout.jsx nav items accordingly.

### M49: Life Goals & Todo Planning

Extends the existing goal system in `server/services/identity.js` and `data/digital-twin/goals.json`. Adds rich progress tracking, todo sub-tasks, calendar time-blocking, and AI-powered check-ins. Gets its own top-level Goals page (not buried under Digital Twin).

**Phases:**

- **P1: Enhanced Goal Model & Todos** — Extend goal schema with: progress percentage + history, velocity (percent/month + trend), projected completion date, todo sub-tasks with status/priority/time estimates, time tracking (total minutes, weekly average). Dedicated Goals page with goal list and detail view
- **P2: Calendar Time-Blocking** (depends on M48 P2) — Schedule recurring goal work sessions on calendar, link calendar events to goals/todos via IDs, track actual time spent from calendar event durations, per-goal calendar config (preferred days, time slot preference, session duration)
- **P3: Check-in & Evaluation** — Periodic check-in prompts (weekly/monthly configurable per goal), AI evaluator uses Digital Twin + progress data to assess trajectory, timeline adjustment recommendations when behind schedule, CoS autonomous job `job-goal-check-in` for weekly evaluations, check-in history with mood/notes
- **P4: Dashboard & Visualization** — Goal progress dashboard widget with urgency badges, burn-down / progress timeline charts, integration with existing mortality-aware urgency scoring (M42 P3), "on track" / "behind" / "at risk" status indicators

**Data:** Extended `data/digital-twin/goals.json` with `todos[]`, `progressHistory[]`, `velocity{}`, `checkIns[]`, `calendarConfig{}`, `timeTracking{}` per goal. `checkInSchedule{}` at root level.

**Routes:** Extend `/api/digital-twin/identity/goals` with: `PUT /:id/progress`, `POST /:id/check-in`, `POST /:id/todos`, `PUT /:id/todos/:tid`, `POST /:id/schedule`, `POST /evaluate`

**Nav:** Top-level sidebar item "Goals" (alphabetically between Digital Twin and Insights)

*Touches: server/services/identity.js (extend), new server/services/goalEvaluator.js, server/routes/identity.js (extend), client/src/pages/Goals.jsx, client/src/components/goals/tabs/, Layout.jsx, autonomousJobs.js*

### M50: Messages (Email Management)

Multi-provider email integration — Gmail via MCP, Outlook/Teams via CDP browser automation (Playwright). Unified Messages page with Inbox, Drafts, Sync, and Config sub-pages.

Always review before send — AI-generated drafts go to an outbox queue. The user reviews, edits, and approves each response before it's sent. No auto-send.

**Completed:** P1-P6.5 (Email sync, AI triage, reply generation, thread capture, config, per-action models, prompt injection hardening, per-message re-fetch). See git history for details.

**Remaining:**

- [ ] **P7: Digital Twin voice drafting** — Draft responses using Digital Twin voice/style (reads COMMUNICATION.md, PERSONALITY.md, VALUES.md + recent thread context)
- [ ] **P8: CoS Automation & Rules** — Automated classification on new emails via CoS job, rule-based pre-filtering, email-to-task pipeline, priority email notifications
- [ ] **P9: Auto-Send with AI Review Gate** — Remove human-in-the-loop for trusted accounts. Before auto-sending, a second LLM call reviews the draft against the original email for: prompt injection artifacts, off-topic content, tone/identity drift, leaked system instructions. Configurable per-account trust level (manual → review-assisted → auto-send). See [Messages Security](./docs/features/messages-security.md) for threat model.

**Data:** `data/messages/accounts.json`, `data/messages/cache/{accountId}.json`, `data/messages/selectors.json`, `settings.json` (messages key for AI config + templates)

**Routes:** `GET /api/messages/inbox`, `GET /api/messages/:accountId/:messageId`, `GET /api/messages/thread/:accountId/:threadId`, `POST /api/messages/sync/:accountId`, `POST /api/messages/:accountId/:messageId/refresh`, `POST /api/messages/fetch-full/:accountId`, `POST /api/messages/accounts/:id/cache/clear`, `POST /api/messages/evaluate`, `POST /api/messages/drafts/generate`, CRUD for accounts/drafts/selectors

**Nav:** Collapsible "Messages" sidebar section with Drafts, Inbox, Sync, Config sub-pages

### M52: Update Detection

Check for new PortOS releases on GitHub and notify the user when an update is available.

**Version Check**
- Scheduled service polls `GET https://api.github.com/repos/atomantic/PortOS/releases/latest` (or tags endpoint) on a configurable interval (default: daily)
- Compare remote latest tag against local version from `package.json`
- Semver comparison — only flag when remote is newer (ignore pre-release tags unless opted in)
- Cache last-checked timestamp and latest remote version in `data/settings.json` or `data/update-check.json`

**UI Notifications**
- Dashboard widget: subtle banner when update available showing current vs. latest version
- Settings page: "Check for Updates" button with last-checked timestamp, auto-check toggle, and interval config
- Sidebar badge or indicator on Settings nav item when update is pending

**Update Action**
- Display release notes summary (fetched from GitHub release body)
- "View Release" link opens GitHub release page
- Optional: show one-liner shell command to pull the update (`git pull && npm run install:all && pm2 restart ecosystem.config.cjs`)

**Routes:** `GET /api/system/update-check` (returns current version, latest version, update available boolean, release notes), `POST /api/system/update-check` (trigger manual check)

**Nav:** No new nav item — surfaces in Dashboard widget and Settings page

*Touches: new server/services/updateCheck.js, server/routes/system.js, Dashboard.jsx (update banner widget), Settings page (update check section), data/update-check.json*

### Tier 1: Identity Integration (aligns with M42 direction)
