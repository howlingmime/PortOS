## Planned Feature Details

### M44 P7: Apple Health Integration

Bring Apple Health data into MeatSpace via two complementary paths: live sync from the [Health Auto Export](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/health-auto-export-json-csv/id1115567069) iOS app (~$4) and bulk historical import from Apple Health XML exports.

**Live Sync (Health Auto Export)**
- `POST /api/health/ingest` — accepts Health Auto Export JSON payload (metrics, workouts, sleep, ECG, medications)
- Validate payload with Zod, deduplicate by metric name + timestamp
- Persist to `data/health/YYYY-MM-DD.json` (one file per day, append/merge)
- Configure app to POST to `http://<tailscale-ip>:5554/api/health/ingest` on 15-60 min interval
- Support custom auth header for basic request validation
- 150+ metric types: steps, heart rate, HRV, VO2 max, sleep stages, blood pressure, workouts with GPS routes, etc.
- Reference: [health-auto-export-server](https://github.com/HealthyApps/health-auto-export-server), [payload schema](https://github.com/Lybron/health-auto-export)

**Bulk Historical Import (XML Export)**
- `POST /api/health/import-xml` — accepts Apple Health export ZIP upload
- Stream-parse `export.xml` using `xml-stream` (files can be 500MB+), extract records into same `data/health/YYYY-MM-DD.json` format
- Progress reporting via WebSocket during import
- Reference: [apple-health-parser](https://github.com/cvyl/apple-health-parser)

**MeatSpace Dashboard Integration**
- New dashboard cards for key Apple Health metrics (steps, heart rate, sleep, HRV trends)
- Correlate with existing MeatSpace data (alcohol intake vs. HRV/sleep, blood work trends vs. activity)
- Time-series charts with configurable date ranges

*Touches: server/routes/health.js, server/services/healthIngest.js, MeatSpace UI, data/health/*

### M45: Data Backup & Recovery

All PortOS data lives in `./data/` as JSON files with no redundancy. A corrupted write, accidental deletion, or disk failure loses everything — brain captures, digital identity, health records, memory embeddings, agent state, and run history.

**Scheduled Backup**
- Configurable backup target (external drive path, NAS mount, or rsync destination)
- Incremental backups using file modification timestamps — only copy changed files
- Configurable schedule (daily default) via existing automation scheduler
- Retention policy: keep N daily + N weekly snapshots, prune older
- Backup manifest with file checksums for integrity verification

**Restore**
- `POST /api/backup/restore` — restore from a named snapshot
- Dry-run mode that shows what would change before applying
- Per-directory selective restore (e.g., restore only `data/brain/` without touching `data/cos/`)

**Dashboard Widget**
- Last backup time, next scheduled backup, total backup size
- Backup health status (green/yellow/red based on age and integrity)
- One-click manual backup trigger

*Touches: new server/services/backup.js, server/routes/backup.js, Dashboard widget, settings.json, automation scheduler*

### M46: Unified Search (Cmd+K)

Global keyboard-driven search across all PortOS data sources from any page.

**Search Sources**
- Brain captures (ideas, projects, people, admin)
- Semantic memory (vector + BM25 hybrid, already exists)
- Command history and AI run history
- Agent activity and task logs
- Apps registry
- Digital twin documents, autobiography, taste summaries
- MeatSpace health entries

**UI**
- `Cmd+K` / `Ctrl+K` opens search overlay from any page
- Type-ahead with categorized results (Brain, Memory, Apps, History, etc.)
- Result cards with source icon, snippet, and timestamp
- Click navigates to deep-linked location (e.g., specific brain capture, agent run, history entry)

**Implementation**
- Server-side `/api/search` endpoint that fans out to existing service search functions
- Client-side `GlobalSearch` component mounted in Layout.jsx
- Debounced input with 200ms delay
- Results ranked by relevance with source-type boosting

*Touches: new server/routes/search.js, new server/services/search.js, new client/src/components/GlobalSearch.jsx, Layout.jsx*

### M47: Push Notifications

External notification delivery for critical events when not actively viewing the dashboard.

**Notification Channels**
- Discord webhook (post to a private channel)
- Telegram bot (send to chat ID)
- Generic webhook (POST JSON to any URL)
- Configurable per-channel: which event types to send

**Events**
- Agent task completed (with success/failure status and summary)
- Critical errors (PM2 crash, autofixer triggered)
- Goal milestone reached
- CoS health alert (agent stuck, high failure rate)
- Backup completed or failed (M45)

**Configuration**
- Settings page section for notification channels
- Per-channel event type toggles
- Test button to verify delivery
- Rate limiting to prevent notification spam (max N per hour per channel)

*Touches: new server/services/pushNotify.js, server/routes/settings.js, Settings UI, cosEvents.js, errorRecovery.js*

### M48: Google Calendar Integration

Shared Google OAuth2 foundation — `server/services/googleAuth.js` handles OAuth2 consent flow, token storage/refresh, scope management. Tokens stored in `data/google/auth.json`. Reused by both Calendar and Gmail.

**Phases:**

- **P1: Calendar Read & OAuth** — Google OAuth2 service, calendar event listing, basic week/month calendar UI, settings page for Google connection
- **P2: Calendar Write & Sync** — Event CRUD (create/update/delete synced to Google), two-way incremental sync using Google's `syncToken`, conflict detection (last-writer-wins, Google as source of truth for external events), configurable sync interval (default 5min)
- **P3: Smart Scheduling & CoS** — Free slot finder API, chronotype-aware slot selection (reads `data/digital-twin/chronotype.json` for peak-focus windows), auto-schedule human tasks during optimal windows, CoS autonomous job `job-calendar-schedule` for rescheduling when conflicts arise
- **P4: Calendar UI Polish** — Week/day/month views, color coding by source/type, dashboard calendar widget (today's events), linked goal/todo indicators on events

**Data:** `data/google/auth.json` (OAuth tokens), `data/calendar/events.json` (local event cache with Google sync tokens), `data/calendar/config.json` (sync settings, working hours, chronotype preferences)

**Routes:** `GET/POST/PUT/DELETE /api/calendar/events`, `POST /api/calendar/sync`, `GET /api/calendar/free-slots`, `POST /api/calendar/schedule-task`, `GET /api/google/oauth/start`, `GET /api/google/oauth/callback`, `GET /api/google/status`

**Nav:** Top-level sidebar item "Calendar" (alphabetically between Chief of Staff and Dev Tools)

*Touches: new server/services/googleAuth.js, server/services/calendar.js, server/services/calendarScheduler.js, server/routes/google.js, server/routes/calendar.js, client/src/pages/Calendar.jsx, client/src/components/calendar/tabs/, Layout.jsx, autonomousJobs.js, data/digital-twin/chronotype.json*

### M49: Life Goals & Todo Planning

Extends the existing goal system in `server/services/identity.js` and `data/digital-twin/goals.json`. Adds rich progress tracking, todo sub-tasks, calendar time-blocking, and AI-powered check-ins. Gets its own top-level Goals page (not buried under Digital Twin).

**Phases:**

- **P1: Enhanced Goal Model & Todos** — Extend goal schema with: progress percentage + history, velocity (percent/month + trend), projected completion date, todo sub-tasks with status/priority/time estimates, time tracking (total minutes, weekly average). Dedicated Goals page with goal list and detail view
- **P2: Calendar Time-Blocking** (depends on M48 P2) — Schedule recurring goal work sessions on calendar, link calendar events to goals/todos via IDs, track actual time spent from calendar event durations, per-goal calendar config (preferred days, time slot preference, session duration)
- **P3: Check-in & Evaluation** — Periodic check-in prompts (weekly/monthly configurable per goal), AI evaluator uses Digital Twin + progress data to assess trajectory, timeline adjustment recommendations when behind schedule, CoS autonomous job `job-goal-check-in` for weekly evaluations, check-in history with mood/notes
- **P4: Dashboard & Visualization** — Goal progress dashboard widget with urgency badges, burn-down / progress timeline charts, integration with existing mortality-aware urgency scoring (M42 P3), "on track" / "behind" / "at risk" status indicators

**Data:** Extended `data/digital-twin/goals.json` with `todos[]`, `progressHistory[]`, `velocity{}`, `checkIns[]`, `calendarConfig{}`, `timeTracking{}` per goal. `checkInSchedule{}` at root level.

**Routes:** Extend `/api/digital-twin/identity/goals` with: `PUT /:id/progress`, `POST /:id/check-in`, `POST /:id/todos`, `PUT /:id/todos/:tid`, `POST /:id/schedule`, `POST /evaluate`

**Nav:** Top-level sidebar item "Goals" (alphabetically between Digital Twin and Insights)

*Touches: server/services/identity.js (extend), new server/services/goalEvaluator.js, server/routes/identity.js (extend), client/src/pages/Goals.jsx, client/src/components/goals/tabs/, Layout.jsx, autonomousJobs.js*

### M50: Messages (Email Management)

Multi-provider email integration — Gmail via MCP, Outlook/Teams via CDP browser automation (Playwright). Unified Messages page with Inbox, Drafts, Sync, and Config sub-pages.

Always review before send — AI-generated drafts go to an outbox queue. The user reviews, edits, and approves each response before it's sent. No auto-send.

**Completed:**

- [x] **P1: Email Read & Sync** — Outlook CDP browser scraping with `[role='listbox'] [role='option']` selectors, Gmail MCP integration, account CRUD, Sync Unread / Full Sync modes with scrolling for virtualized lists, message caching with dedup
- [x] **P2: AI Triage & Inbox Actions** — AI evaluation endpoint (`POST /messages/evaluate`) classifies messages as reply/archive/delete/review with priority, inbox shows action badges + priority dots + pin/flag indicators, 1-click "Draft" button generates AI reply and navigates to Drafts
- [x] **P3: AI Reply Generation** — Real AI reply using configured provider/model and customizable prompt templates (reply + forward), `{{variable}}` substitution, settings persisted in `settings.json`
- [x] **P3.5: Full Body & Thread Capture** — Outlook sync clicks into each conversation to extract full email body (not just 300-char preview). Conversation threads linked by `threadId`. `GET /messages/thread/:accountId/:threadId` endpoint. MessageDetail shows full conversation chain with "Preview only" indicator for uncaptured messages. Dedup preserves full body upgrades on re-sync.
- [x] **P4: Config Page** — Unified Config tab with AI Provider & Model selector, prompt template editor, and email account management

**Remaining TODO:**

- [x] **P5: Per-action model selection** — Separate provider/model configs for triage vs reply generation (different cost/capability tiers). Expand `settings.messages` to `{ triage: { providerId, model }, reply: { providerId, model } }`. Update ConfigTab with two `ProviderModelSelector` sections.
- [x] **P6: Prompt injection hardening** — XML-fence untrusted email content in AI prompts to prevent injection. Add content sanitization layer (`sanitize()` escapes `<>`), `<emails>` XML fencing on eval prompt.
- [x] **P6.5: Per-message re-fetch & detail fetch fixes** — Refresh button in MessageDetail re-clicks conversation and re-extracts full body (bypasses cache). Inbox-level "Fetch Full Content" button runs detail fetch for all preview-only messages. Clear Cache button per account in Config. Note: Outlook marks messages as read when opened for detail fetch (native behavior, documented as known limitation).
- [ ] **P7: Digital Twin voice drafting** — Draft responses using Digital Twin voice/style (reads COMMUNICATION.md, PERSONALITY.md, VALUES.md + recent thread context)
- [ ] **P8: CoS Automation & Rules** — Automated classification on new emails via CoS job, rule-based pre-filtering, email-to-task pipeline, priority email notifications
- [ ] **P9: Auto-Send with AI Review Gate** — Remove human-in-the-loop for trusted accounts. Before auto-sending, a second LLM call reviews the draft against the original email for: prompt injection artifacts, off-topic content, tone/identity drift, leaked system instructions. Configurable per-account trust level (manual → review-assisted → auto-send). See [Messages Security](./docs/features/messages-security.md) for threat model.
- [x] **Cleanup** — Delete unused `client/src/components/messages/AccountsTab.jsx` (replaced by ConfigTab)

**Data:** `data/messages/accounts.json`, `data/messages/cache/{accountId}.json`, `data/messages/selectors.json`, `settings.json` (messages key for AI config + templates)

**Routes:** `GET /api/messages/inbox`, `GET /api/messages/:accountId/:messageId`, `GET /api/messages/thread/:accountId/:threadId`, `POST /api/messages/sync/:accountId`, `POST /api/messages/:accountId/:messageId/refresh`, `POST /api/messages/fetch-full/:accountId`, `POST /api/messages/accounts/:id/cache/clear`, `POST /api/messages/evaluate`, `POST /api/messages/drafts/generate`, CRUD for accounts/drafts/selectors

**Nav:** Collapsible "Messages" sidebar section with Drafts, Inbox, Sync, Config sub-pages

### M52: Update Detection

Check for new PortOS releases on GitHub and notify the user when an update is available.

- Scheduled service polls `GET https://api.github.com/repos/atomantic/PortOS/releases/latest` (or tags endpoint) on a configurable interval (default: daily)
- Compare remote latest tag against local version from `package.json`
- Semver comparison — only flag when remote is newer (ignore pre-release tags unless opted in)
- Cache last-checked timestamp and latest remote version in `data/settings.json` or `data/update-check.json`

**UI Notifications**
- Dashboard widget: subtle banner when update available showing current vs. latest version
- Settings page: "Check for Updates" button with last-checked timestamp, auto-check toggle, and interval config
- Sidebar badge or indicator on Settings nav item when update is pending

**Update Action**
- Display release notes summary (fetched from GitHub release body)
- "View Release" link opens GitHub release page
- Optional: show one-liner shell command to pull the update (`git pull && npm run install:all && pm2 restart ecosystem.config.cjs`)

**Routes:** `GET /api/system/update-check` (returns current version, latest version, update available boolean, release notes), `POST /api/system/update-check` (trigger manual check)

**Nav:** No new nav item — surfaces in Dashboard widget and Settings page

## Better Audit - 2026-03-05 (Pass 3)

Summary: 22 new actionable findings across 16 files. 1 shared utility to extract (fetchWithTimeout).

### Foundation — Shared Utilities
1. **fetchWithTimeout** — `fetchWithTimeout(url, options, timeoutMs)` wraps fetch with AbortController timeout. Replaces 8+ duplicate patterns in cosRunnerClient.js, memoryClassifier.js, visionTest.js, lmStudioManager.js, etc. Create as `server/lib/fetchWithTimeout.js`.

### File Ownership Map

### Bugs, Performance & Error Handling
- [ ] **[CRITICAL]** `server/services/cosRunnerClient.js:91-313` - 12 fetch calls missing AbortController/timeout (only spawnAgentViaRunner and executeCliRunViaRunner have timeouts). Fix: Use fetchWithTimeout for all calls. Complexity: Simple
- [ ] **[HIGH]** `server/services/cosRunnerClient.js:19-26` - Socket.IO with `reconnectionAttempts: Infinity` and no error handler. Fix: Cap at 10, add error handler. Complexity: Simple
- [ ] **[HIGH]** `server/services/memory.js:203-214` - Data race: loadMemory() called outside withMemoryLock, then accessCount incremented inside lock. Fix: Move loadMemory inside lock. Complexity: Simple
- [ ] **[HIGH]** `server/services/agentActionExecutor.js:137` - Unsafe fallback: `commentsResponse.comments || commentsResponse || []` may yield non-array. Fix: Use Array.isArray check. Complexity: Simple
- [ ] **[MEDIUM]** `server/services/cos.js:211-221` - Migration rename fallback: copy failure silently swallowed. Fix: Add error propagation in fallback path. Complexity: Simple
- [ ] **[MEDIUM]** `server/services/memory.js:220-265` - Sort comparison not type-safe for dates (ISO strings compared as numbers via `|| 0`). Fix: Add type-aware comparison. Complexity: Medium
- [ ] **[MEDIUM]** `server/services/cos.js:83-101` - Agent index lazy-load race: concurrent calls both trigger migration. Fix: Use promise-based singleton pattern. Complexity: Medium

### Code Quality & Style
- [ ] **[HIGH]** `server/services/memorySync.js:156` - `result.rows[0].max_seq` without checking rows length. Fix: Add bounds check. Complexity: Simple
- [ ] **[HIGH]** `server/lib/db.js:85` - Destructuring `result.rows[0]` without row existence check. Fix: Add bounds check. Complexity: Simple
- [ ] **[MEDIUM]** `server/services/lmStudioManager.js:12` - Hardcoded `http://localhost:1234`. Fix: Use `process.env.LM_STUDIO_URL` with fallback. Complexity: Simple
- [ ] **[MEDIUM]** `server/services/memoryClassifier.js:24` - Hardcoded `http://localhost:1234/v1/chat/completions`. Fix: Use env var with fallback. Complexity: Simple
- [ ] **[MEDIUM]** `client/src/pages/Browser.jsx:87`, `client/src/pages/Shell.jsx:81`, `client/src/components/cos/TaskAddForm.jsx:106`, `client/src/hooks/useAgentFeedbackToast.jsx:43`, `client/src/components/meatspace/HealthCategorySection.jsx:48` - Empty `.catch(() => {})` swallowing errors. Fix: Replace with `console.warn`. Complexity: Simple
- [ ] **[MEDIUM]** `client/src/pages/DevTools.jsx:21-40` - Stale closure risk: `loadData` depends on `filter` but not wrapped in useCallback. Fix: Wrap in useCallback with [filter] dep. Complexity: Simple
- [ ] **[MEDIUM]** `server/services/contextUpgrader.js` - Unused 350-line module with 0 imports. Fix: DELETE file. Complexity: Simple

### Architecture & SOLID (tracked, not auto-remediated)
- [ ] **[CRITICAL]** `server/services/cos.js` (3837 lines) - God file with 40+ exports. evaluateTasks() is 346 lines with 5-level nesting. (Complexity: Very Complex)
- [ ] **[CRITICAL]** `server/services/subAgentSpawner.js` (3284 lines) - 10 imports from cos.js, spawnDirectly/spawnViaRunner have 11/10 parameters. (Complexity: Very Complex)
- [ ] **[HIGH]** `client/src/services/api.js` (1627 lines) - Monolithic API client mixing 20+ domains. (Complexity: Medium)
- [ ] **[HIGH]** `server/services/digital-twin.js` (2823 lines) - Mixed CRUD, LLM testing, enrichment, export. (Complexity: Complex)
- [ ] **[HIGH]** `server/routes/cos.js` (1253 lines) - Business logic mixed with HTTP handlers. (Complexity: Medium)
- [ ] **[HIGH]** `client/src/pages/ChiefOfStaff.jsx` (864 lines) - 24 useState hooks. (Complexity: Medium)

### DRY & YAGNI (tracked for future passes)
- [ ] **[HIGH]** Duplicate DATA_DIR/path constants in 8+ files — should import from PATHS in fileUtils.js
- [ ] **[MEDIUM]** 39 instances of `mkdir({recursive:true})` vs centralized `ensureDir()`
- [ ] **[MEDIUM]** JSON read/write pattern variations (203 occurrences)

### Test Coverage (tracked, not auto-remediated)
- [ ] **[CRITICAL]** `server/services/cos.js` - No tests for 3837-line core service (45 test cases needed)
- [ ] **[CRITICAL]** `server/services/cosRunnerClient.js` - No tests for 16 fetch functions (32 test cases needed)
- [ ] **[CRITICAL]** `server/services/agentActionExecutor.js` - No tests for 661-line service (24 test cases needed)
- [ ] **[CRITICAL]** `server/services/memorySync.js` - No tests for sync service (18 test cases needed)
- [ ] **[HIGH]** `server/services/autoFixer.js` - No tests for 301-line service
- [ ] **[HIGH]** `server/services/subAgentSpawner.test.js` - Tests use copy-pasted logic instead of importing real functions
- [ ] **[HIGH]** `server/services/digital-twin.test.js` - runTests(), validateCompleteness(), getGapRecommendations() untested
