## Added

- **M50 P7: Gmail API Sync** — Gmail integration via Google API (same OAuth as Calendar). Syncs inbox messages with full body extraction, thread grouping, label mapping, and starred/read status. Sends email via Gmail API with RFC 2822 formatting and reply threading. Archive/delete via API (no browser needed). HTML email rendering in sandboxed iframe. Compact message detail header. Gmail setup checklist in Config with OAuth and API enable controls.
- **M56: Telegram Bot Integration** — Telegram bot for external notifications and conversational commands. Configure bot token and chat ID in Settings. Forwards PortOS notifications (filterable by type) to Telegram with rate limiting. Bot commands: `/status`, `/goals`, `/agents`, `/checkin`, `/help`. Check-in responses are persisted for goal tracking.
- **M49 P1: Goal Todos & Progress Tracking** — Enhanced goal model with explicit progress percentage, todo sub-tasks (with priority and time estimates), velocity tracking (percent/month with trend), projected completion dates, and time tracking aggregates. Progress bar and todos visible in both goal list rows and detail panel.
- **M49 P2-P4: Goal Planning, Calendar & Check-ins** — Set target dates on goals, generate AI-powered phase plans (3-7 milestones with dates), edit/reorder/accept proposed phases. Schedule time blocks on Google Calendar based on preferred days, time slots, and session duration. Automated weekly goal check-ins via autonomous job: computes expected vs actual progress, determines on-track/behind/at-risk status, generates AI assessment and recommendations, sends Telegram notification. Google Calendar OAuth upgraded to read-write scope with upgrade detection.

- **POST Deep Routes & Elements Expansion** — POST section now uses deep-linkable routes (`/post/launcher`, `/post/memory`, `/post/history`, `/post/config`, `/post/memory/elements`) instead of internal state switching. Sidebar nav expanded to collapsible section with sub-pages. Added 16 missing elements (103-118, Lawrencium through Oganesson) to the periodic table and element map. New appendix verse set for memorizing the post-Lehrer elements. Fixed missing Mercury (Hg) in periodic table grid. Period 7 now shows all elements. Interactive periodic table with hover tooltips, click-to-highlight verse, search filter, mastery/category view toggle, and element category color coding.

- **App Icon Detection** — Apps can now display their actual project icon (favicon, Xcode AppIcon, etc.) instead of generic SVG icons. Auto-detects icons from well-known paths during app import and config refresh. Supports Xcode/iOS AppIcon.appiconset, web favicons, logos, and common icon locations. Icon served via `GET /api/apps/:id/icon` with fallback to SVG icons. Bulk "Detect Icons" button on Apps page. Apps sorted alphabetically on both Dashboard and Apps pages. App icons shown in Apps list rows.

- **Review Briefing Fullscreen** — Daily Briefing section in Review Hub now has a fullscreen toggle button and increased default content height for better readability

- **Database Management UI** — Switch between Docker and native PostgreSQL from the Settings page. Shows live status of both backends with connection health and memory count. Migrate data between backends with one click. Export database, install/setup native PostgreSQL, and fix stale PID files — all from the UI with real-time progress via WebSocket

## Changed

- **CoS feature-ideas task** — Agents now implement the next unchecked PLAN.md item instead of inventing features. When user clarification is needed, agents create a `.plan-questions.md` marker and a `plan_question` notification linking to the Documents tab. Added `{appId}` template variable for prompt linking.
- **CoS task prompt enhancement** — Enhance prompt now instructs the LLM to research the codebase (find relevant files, patterns, conventions), plan the approach, and produce a codebase-grounded prompt with specific file paths and implementation steps instead of generic advice

## Fixed

- **Self-build crash** — Fixed PortOS build button killing the server mid-build. `npm install` in `server/` triggered PM2's file watcher restart (SIGINT) which killed the build child process. Self-builds now skip server install (already running) and use `shell: true` for proper PATH resolution. Build error messages now include exit code, signal, and stdout/stderr output.

- **Apps page crash** — Fixed `Cannot access 'isNonPm2' before initialization` error caused by self-referencing variable declaration in Apps.jsx
- **Memory display truncation** — Show full memory text in CoS Memory tab and Telegram notifications instead of truncating to 100-200 characters
- **CoS task form clarity** — Renamed "Branch + PR" to "Worktree + PR" across task form, schedule tab, and app settings with descriptive tooltips explaining that unchecked means commits go directly to the default branch
