# Unreleased Changes

## Added
- Nicotine tracking tab in MeatSpace with consumption logging, daily totals, rolling averages, custom product quick-add buttons, inline editing, and entry history
- Nicotine chart (7d/30d/90d bar chart) and nicotine vs heart rate correlation visualization
- Nicotine data integrated into health correlation endpoint (HR, resting HR alongside nicotine mg)
- Server-side nicotine service with daily log persistence, custom product management, and caching
- Date editing on alcohol and nicotine history entries (move items between dates)
- Nicotine sub-nav link in MeatSpace sidebar
- Telegram MCP Bridge mode: uses Claude Code's Telegram plugin for outbound notifications via direct Bot API HTTP calls, with inbound messages handled by Claude Code's natural language processing instead of rigid bot commands
- Settings toggle to switch between Manual Bot and Claude MCP Bridge integration methods
- Interactive storage backend chooser during setup: Docker PostgreSQL, Native PostgreSQL, or file-based JSON (deprecated) when Docker is unavailable

## Changed
- Extracted shared `dayOfWeek` utility and `DAY_LABELS` constant to meatspace constants (deduplicated from AlcoholTab)
- Health correlation endpoint now includes heart rate, resting heart rate, and nicotine data alongside existing HRV/alcohol/steps
- NicotineHealthCorrelation tooltip uses Tailwind classes instead of inline styles for consistency
- Extracted `recalcAlcoholTotal()` helper and reuse across logDrink, updateDrink, removeDrink
- AlcoholTab correlation date range wrapped in useMemo to prevent unnecessary API refetches
- Nicotine mg/unit form field uses placeholder instead of default value
- Nicotine page redesigned: compact stat bar, merged quick-add/custom entry card, collapsible custom form, table-based history, side-by-side charts
- Alcohol page summary compressed into a single compact stat bar row to maximize above-the-fold content

## Fixed
- Calendar day view current-time red line now updates every 60 seconds instead of only on page load
- Stokes Pick default nicotine amount corrected from 3mg to 5mg
- UTC timezone shift showing tomorrow's date in alcohol/nicotine forms — replaced `toISOString()` with local `localDateStr()` utility
- Server-side rolling averages and summary use local dates instead of UTC — fixes today showing 0mg despite logged entries
- Chart date range comparison uses local date strings instead of UTC Date objects — fixes today/yesterday missing from 7-day chart
- Empty entry objects no longer accumulate in daily-log.json after moving the last item from a date

## Removed
