## Added

- **Xcode Multi-Platform template** — new "Xcode Multi-Platform" app template scaffolds a SwiftUI project with iOS, macOS, and watchOS targets via XcodeGen
  - Generic `deploy.sh` with `--ios`, `--macos`, `--watch`, `--all` flags for TestFlight deployment
  - Generic `take_screenshots.sh` and `take_screenshots_macos.sh` for App Store screenshot automation
  - UI test target with `ScreenshotTests.swift` stubs for XCUITest-based screenshot capture
  - Shared module for cross-platform code, macOS entitlements, watchOS companion app
- **Xcode script health check** — PortOS now detects missing management scripts (deploy, screenshots) in Xcode-managed apps and surfaces a banner in the app detail overview with one-click install
- Deploy panel now includes `--watch` (watchOS) flag option
- **Obsidian Notes Manager** in Brain section — browse, search, edit, and create notes in Obsidian vaults synced via iCloud
  - Auto-detects Obsidian vaults from iCloud directory
  - Vault browser with folder tree, search, tags panel, and markdown preview with wikilink navigation
  - Inline note editor with Cmd+S save, backlinks panel, and frontmatter properties view
  - Full-text search with context snippets and relevance ranking
  - Link graph endpoint for vault-wide wikilink visualization

## Fixed

- **Simplify agent summary visibility** — completed agents that ran with `/simplify` now extract and display a separate "Task Summary" showing what the agent accomplished, so the original work summary is no longer buried under the simplify review output

- **Memory dedup — duplicate approval requests** — memory extractor now checks existing active and pending memories (via vector similarity + text prefix matching) before proposing new ones, and the LLM classification prompt now includes existing memories so it avoids re-proposing semantically equivalent knowledge

- **Xcode `deploy.sh` template — altool upload check false-positive** — generated deploy scripts grepped altool output for plain `ERROR: ` to detect upload failures, but altool's multipart uploader logs every transient retry as `ERROR: [ContentDelivery.Uploader.X] WILL RETRY PART N. Checksums do not match.` On flaky/slow networks the script killed deploys mid-recovery. Switched to Apple's definitive failure markers only: `UPLOAD FAILED|Validation failed \(|ERROR ITMS-|product-errors`. Affects iOS, macOS, and watchOS upload sections in `xcodeScripts.js`.
- Submodule status API (`/api/git/submodules/status`) always returned empty array — `stdout.trim()` was stripping the leading space status character from `git submodule status` output, causing the regex parser to fail
- CoS agents page crash: pipe characters (`|`) in task descriptions triggered infinite loop in markdown parser — non-table pipes now treated as normal text with safety fallback
- CoS agents API returned full output arrays (600KB+) for all agents in listing — output now stripped from listing response and loaded on demand
- **Resume Agent modal not dismissing** — clicking "Queue Resume Task" successfully queued the task but left the modal open; modal now closes on successful submit
- **Pending task edit form unresponsive** — save/cancel buttons on the edit form for pending tasks did not respond to taps; dnd-kit's sortable wrapper interfered with pointer events inside sortable items. Sorting is now disabled while editing, pointer events are stopped from propagating through the edit form, and button touch targets are enlarged to 40px minimum height
- **Broken worktree detection** — worktree cleanup now verifies `rev-parse --show-toplevel` matches the expected worktree path before trusting `git status`; prevents broken worktrees (missing `.git` file) from resolving to a parent repo and incorrectly blocking removal
